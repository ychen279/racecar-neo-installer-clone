Title: Lab 5 - Cone Parking

Author: [PLACEHOLDER] << [Write your name or team name here]

Purpose: This script provides the RACECAR with the ability to autonomously detect an orange
cone and then drive and park 30cm away from the cone. Complete the lines of code under the 
#TODO indicators to complete the lab.

Expected Outcome: When the user runs the script, the RACECAR should be fully autonomous
and drive without the assistance of the user. The RACECAR drives according to the following
rules:
- The RACECAR detects the orange cone using its color camera, and can navigate to the cone
and park using its color camera and LIDAR sensors.
- The RACECAR should operate on a state machine with multiple states. There should not be
a terminal state. If there is no cone in the environment, the program should not crash.

Environment: Test your code using the level "Neo Labs > Lab 5: Cone Parking".
Click on the screen to move the orange cone around the screen.
