Title: Lab 3 - Stoplight Challenge

Author: [PLACEHOLDER] << [Write your name or team name here]

Purpose: Write a script to enable autonomous behavior from the RACECAR. When
the RACECAR sees a stoplight object (colored cube in the simulator), respond accordingly
by going straight, turning right, turning left, or stopping. Append instructions to the
queue depending on whether the position of the RACECAR relative to the stoplight reaches
a certain threshold, and be able to respond to traffic lights at consecutive intersections. 

Expected Outcome: When the user runs the script, the RACECAR should control itself using
the following constraints:
- When the RACECAR sees a BLUE traffic light, make a right turn at the intersection
- When the RACECAR sees an ORANGE traffic light, make a left turn at the intersection
- When the RACECAR sees a GREEN traffic light, go straight
- When the RACECAR sees a RED traffic light, stop moving,
- When the RACECAR sees any other traffic light colors, stop moving.

Considerations: Since the user is not controlling the RACECAR, be sure to consider the
following scenarios:
- What should the RACECAR do if it sees two traffic lights, one at the current intersection
and the other at the intersection behind it?
- What should be the constraint for adding the instructions to the queue? Traffic light position,
traffic light area, or both?
- How often should the instruction-adding function calls be? Once, twice, or 60 times a second?

Environment: Test your code using the level "Neo Labs > Lab 3: Stoplight Challenge".
By default, the traffic lights should direct you in a counterclockwise circle around the course.
For testing purposes, you may change the color of the traffic light by first left-clicking to 
select and then right clicking on the light to scroll through available colors.
