Title: Lab 2 - Driving in Mazes

Author: [PLACEHOLDER] << [Write your name or team name here]

Purpose: Create a script to enable semi-autonomous driving for the RACECAR. Button presses
enable a series of instructions sent to the RACECAR, which enable it to drive in various mazes.
Complete the lines of code under the #TODO indicators to complete the lab.

Expected Outcome: When the user runs the script, they are able to control the RACECAR
using the following keys:
- When the "A" button is pressed, drive through the first obstacle titled "Zigzag".
- When the "B" button is pressed, drive through the second obstacle titled "Spiral".
- When the "X" button is pressed, drive through the third obstacle titled "Hallway".
- When the "Y" button is pressed, drive through the fourth obstacle titled "Maze". [BONUS!]

Environment: Test your code using the level "Neo Labs > Lab 2: Driving in Mazes".
Use the "TAB" key to switch between each maze. The RACECAR starts at the white line (checkpoint)
and ends at the green pad at the end of the race. Please note if the RACECAR collides with a wall,
it will be reset back to the nearest checkpoint.
